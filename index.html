                        <p>For personal data transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, we will provide appropriate safeguards, such as through use of standard contractual clauses.</p>
                        <p>Governmentjobs.com, Inc complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.

                        <p>We will provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share your sensitive data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal data, please submit a written request to <a href="mailto:privacy@governmentjobs.com">privacy@governmentjobs.com</a>.</p>
                        <p>In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
                        <p>Where Governmentjobs.com, Inc. relies on Privacy Shield Principles for onward transfers of personal data from the EU, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions, Governmentjobs.com, Inc. remains responsible under the Privacy Shield Principles for third-party agents processing personal data on its behalf.</p>

In particular, where where Governmentjobs.com  transfers personal data in reliance on Privacy Shield, Governtmentjobs.com, Inc. remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if any agents that it engages to process personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Governmentjobs.com proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Governmentjobs.com, Inc commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal data transferred in reliance on Privacy Shield to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.

                    <p>The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference are the terms (collectively, these &ldquo;Terms of Use&rdquo;), under which all job seekers, employers or other users (&ldquo;you&rdquo;) may use the NEOGOV Services including any content or functionality offered on or through websites under our control, including  <a href="http://www.neogov.com">www.neogov.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.governmentjobs.com/">www.governmentjobs.com</a>, the subdomains and subdirectories of each and any Add-On Service purchased within a website (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;Services&rdquo; for purposes of this Terms of Use), but excluding services that explicitly state they are subject to different terms and conditions. These Terms of Use are entered into by and between you and Governmentjobs.com, Inc. (referred to as &ldquo;NEOGOV&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, or &ldquo;us&rdquo;).</p>
                    <p>Excluding purchases of Add-On Services, if you are an employer that holds a separately negotiated commercial contract with us (our &ldquo;Customer&rdquo;) that explicitly supersedes or prohibits any end user license or online terms of use, the terms and conditions within such commercial contract shall control to the extent of any direct conflict.</p>
                    <p>Please read the Terms of Use carefully before you start to use the Services.</p>

By using the Services, executing a document that references them, or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Use when this option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy incorporated herein by reference. If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Services.

You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with us and meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Services.</p>
                            <p>We reserve the right to withdraw or amend the Services, and any service or material we provide on the Services, in our sole discretion without notice.

Unless otherwise stated by NEOGOV, Add-On Services are governed by the NEOGOV Services Agreement terms most recently published prior to the purchase or renewal of an Add-On Service, as well as these Terms of Use, Service Specifications, and applicable Schedules incorporated therein (available at: <a href="https://www.neogov.com/service-specifications">https://www.neogov.com/service-specifications</a>). Where the terms of this Section conflict with the NEOGOV Services Agreement, this Section shall control. Add-On Services may only be available through one or more of our Services and Add-On Services may not be available for all End Users or Customers.</li>
                                <li>Payment Authorization. You agree to pay to NEOGOV any fees for each Add-On Service you purchase in accordance with the pricing and payment terms presented to you for that Add-On Service. All Add-On Service fees are in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable.

By providing debit or credit card account information through or to the Services, you represent, warrant, and covenant that: (1) you are legally authorized to provide such information to us; (2) you are legally authorized to perform payments from the debit or credit card account(s); (3) the credit card information you provide is correct and you will promptly notify NEOGOV of any changes to such information; and (4) such action does not violate the terms and conditions applicable to your use of such debit or credit card account(s) or applicable law. When you authorize a payment using a debit or credit card account via the Services, you represent, warrant, and covenant that there are sufficient funds or credit available to complete a payment using the debit or credit card account. NEOGOV&rsquo;s authorized third-party payment processor will charge the payment method you specified at the time of purchase.

If you decide to activate an Add-On Subscription, you authorize NEOGOV to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the recurring payments, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The Add-On Service Subscription Term is a continuous and non-divisible commitment for the full duration of the term regardless of any invoice schedule. The Subscription will commence upon the date you activate or use the Add-On Service. The Subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your Subscription, or we terminate it. You must cancel your Add-On Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic subscription fee to your account. We will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). NEOGOV may change the Subscription Fee for any subsequent Subscription period but will provide you notice of any increase before it applies. Unless otherwise stated in a commercial agreement we negotiated with a Customer, you may cancel an Add-On Subscription by contacting us at: <a href="mailto:accounting@neogov.com">accounting@neogov.com</a>, <a href="mailto:customersupport@neogov.com">customersupport@neogov.com</a>, or alternative means expressly presented to you within the Services.

                                <li>Purchase Order.
